/**
 * @file    onStateUpdate.h
 * @brief   Declaration of the OnStateUpdateListener class for handling game state updates.
 *
 * This file defines the OnStateUpdateListener class, which provides an interface
 * and mechanism to handle updates when the game state changes. It uses a map to associate
 * game states with their corresponding handler functions, allowing modular and extensible
 * state management.
