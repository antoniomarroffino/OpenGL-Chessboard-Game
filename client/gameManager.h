 * @brief GameManager is responsible for managing the state and progression of the game, including handling user inputs,
 *        transitioning between game states, and controlling the camera, lights, pieces, and movements in the game world.
 *        It follows the Singleton design pattern to ensure that there is only one instance of GameManager during the
 *        game lifecycle.
 *
 * This header defines the GameManager class and its methods for handling game initialization, game loop, and various
 * callbacks for keyboard inputs during different game states (e.g., pre-game, choice, game, and end-game). It also manages
 * the game state transitions and calls appropriate methods for handling game actions.

 /**
  * @class GameManager
  * @brief Singleton class responsible for managing the game state, input handling, and transitioning between different game modes.
  *
  * The GameManager class controls the game flow by maintaining and managing various game subsystems such as camera,
  * status, movement, light, history, and game pieces. It also handles user input for camera control, light toggling,
  * piece movement, and game state transitions (pre-game, in-game, and end-game).
  *
  * This class follows the Singleton pattern, meaning only one instance of GameManager can exist during the game
  * lifecycle. It handles the game loop, processes user inputs via keyboard and special keys, and ensures that the
  * appropriate actions are taken at each stage of the game.
