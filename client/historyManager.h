/**
 * @class HistoryManager
 * @brief Manages the history of game state changes, supporting undo and redo operations.
 *
 * The HistoryManager class tracks snapshots of the game state, enabling the functionality to undo and redo movements
 * during the game. It is responsible for storing the game state in a history vector and providing mechanisms to roll back
 * or move forward through the history. It listens to game state changes and updates its internal state accordingly.

     * @brief Destructor for HistoryManager.
     *
     * The destructor is responsible for cleaning up resources when the HistoryManager instance is destroyed.
     * It performs the following actions:
     * - Unsubscribes the HistoryManager as a listener from the StatusManager, ensuring that it no longer receives
     *   updates or notifications from the game state changes.
     * - Iterates over the `m_history` vector, which contains pointers to stored snapshots of the game state,
     *   and deletes each snapshot to free up memory.
     *
     * These steps ensure that the HistoryManager cleans up both its own internal state and any dynamic memory
     * associated with the game state snapshots, preventing memory leaks.
