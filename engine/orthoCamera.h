/**
 * @brief Concrete OrthoCamera class.
 *
 * The OrthoCamera class represents a camera that uses an orthographic projection, where objects are projected
 * without perspective distortion (i.e., parallel lines remain parallel). It inherits from the Camera class and
 * implements the necessary methods to load and apply the orthographic projection matrix.
