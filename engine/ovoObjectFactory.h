 * This file defines the `OVOObjectFactory` class, which is responsible for creating different types of
 * objects (such as nodes, materials, meshes, lights) based on chunk IDs and associated data.
 * The factory handles various object types and subtypes, making it easier to instantiate objects dynamically.

  * @brief Factory class to create objects based on chunk ID and data.
  *
  * The `OVOObjectFactory` class provides a static method `createObjectByChunkID()` to create
  * various objects (e.g., nodes, materials, meshes, lights) depending on the provided chunk ID and data.
  * The factory class ensures that objects are created in a structured manner based on their type and subtype.
