/**
 * @brief Concrete SpotLight class.
 *
 * The SpotLight class represents a spotlight light source in a 3D scene. A spotlight is a light source that
 * emits light in a specific direction, typically with a defined angle of influence (cutoff) and an intensity
 * falloff based on the angle (spot exponent).
